## Key Findings

- **Best LC Win Rate:** caching (71.3% Â± 13.7%)
- **Worst LC Win Rate:** query_routing (48.2%)
- **caching:** Length bias deflated raw win rate by 16.3%
- **semantic_dedup:** Length bias deflated raw win rate by 20.8%
- **caching_second_run:** Length bias deflated raw win rate by 13.2%
- **parallel_batching:** Length bias deflated raw win rate by 12.0%
- **query_routing:** Length bias deflated raw win rate by 8.2%

---
## Statistical Notes

- **LC Win Rate:** Length-controlled win rate using logistic regression
- **95% CI:** Bootstrapped confidence intervals (1000 iterations)
- **Position Bias:** Controlled via balanced randomization
- **Class Imbalance:** Handled with balanced class weights
